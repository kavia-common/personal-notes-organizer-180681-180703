# Flutter Project Root

This directory (notes_frontend) is the root of the Flutter application.

If analysis/build tools run from the repository root, ensure they `cd` here before running Flutter commands:
- cd personal-notes-organizer-180681-180703/notes_frontend
- flutter pub get
- flutter analyze
- flutter test

Alternatively, use the repo scripts:
- bash personal-notes-organizer-180681-180703/run_all_mobile_checks.sh
- bash personal-notes-organizer-180681-180703/run_flutter_here.sh analyze
