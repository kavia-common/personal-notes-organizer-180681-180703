This directory is intentionally present at the workspace root to help some CI analyzers detect a Dart/Flutter context.
The real Flutter project is under: personal-notes-organizer-180681-180703/notes_frontend
Tools should run `flutter pub get`, `flutter analyze`, and `flutter test` from that directory.
